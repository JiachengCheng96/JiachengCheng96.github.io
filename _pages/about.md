I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Yale University, advised by [Prof. Tara Boroushaki](https://taraboroushaki.com/).

Prior to this, I earned my **Ph.D.** from the [Statistical Visual Computing Lab](http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/) at the [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) in 2025, advised by [Prof. Nuno Vasconcelos](http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/~nuno/). I received my undergraduate degree from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2018.
